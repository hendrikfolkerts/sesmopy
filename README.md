INTRODUCTION

The software SESMoPy has been developed by the research group Computational
Engineering and Automation (CEA) at Wismar University of Applied Sciences.
The software implements a modelbuilder according to the System Entity
Structure / Model Base (SES/MB) infrastructure introduced for automatic
execution of simulation experiments. The focus of the software is the model
generation for different modelbuilders.
Please read the documentation for further information. A comprehensive
introduction to the SES/MB theory is given in the documentation of the SES
modeling tool SESToPy.
The software is written in Python3 with PyQt5 as user interface.
It was tested with the simulation softwares Matlab R2018a (for Simulink),
OpenModelica 1.12.0 and Dymola 2018.
Furthermore it makes use of the FMU Compliance Checker developed by Modelon AB.

EXECUTE

The program can be executed from source. Python3 with PyQt5 needs to be installed and the
program can be started with the command:
- in Windows: python main.py
- in Linux: python3 main.py

Versions built for Windows or Linux have an executable with the name "SESMoPy"
in the program directory.
